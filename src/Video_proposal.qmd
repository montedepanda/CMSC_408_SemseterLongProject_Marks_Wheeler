# Design Concept
Creating a new system for defensive point scoring for a system such as fantasy that can look at defensive effiency in more terms than just interceptions, fumble recovery, yards against and points scored. We would like to implement a new system that involves injury/ replacements and offensive fault. We will take certain data that already exists. We will use Madden overalls to determine overall defensive efficieny.
